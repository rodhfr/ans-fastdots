# **ðŸŸ¥ WIP** - not functional yet.
Quicky install *your own* dotfiles and programs using ansible to deploy a new developer environment in seconds.

## Why yet another dotfiles installer?
Tired of installing random dotfiles from the internet and wondering why something breaks afterward?
Dotfiles are meant to be personal â€” this tool helps you automate them in a reproducible and idempotent way.

Use your own dotfiles:
git clone submodule add https://github.com/YourUser/dotfiles.git dotfiles

My own for example sake:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rodhfr/ans-fastdots.git
